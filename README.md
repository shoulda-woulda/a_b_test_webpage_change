### Evaluating the Influence of Color Alteration on Webpage Click Rates through A/B Testing


__Overview:__ This project investigates the effect of changing the colour of the button that takes users to the Contact section of the webpage for a ficticious company called "Quantum Dynamics Innovations, Inc." A Bayesian approach is used due to the ability to perform sequential analysis and make direct probability statements.

__Purpose:__ To inform management whether the change has had a positive or negative effect on the conversion of users to click the button in terms of probabilities.
